Recording was done on analog equipment at Dub Narcotic, Olympia, Washington, from May 2000 to March 2001. 
The album takes influences from numerous music genres such as black metal, ambient and avant-garde, as well as non-musical sources like the American drama television show Twin Peaks and primary member Phil Elverum's relationship to Khaela Maricich. 
Elverum was responsible for the album's production in its entirety.
