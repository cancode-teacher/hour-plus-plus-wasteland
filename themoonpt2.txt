The Glow Pt. 2 is the third studio album by American indie folk and indie rock project the Microphones. 
It was released on September 11, 2001,[1] through K Records and later through P.W. Elverum & Sun, Ltd.
Recording was done on analog equipment at Dub Narcotic, Olympia, Washington, from May 2000 to March 2001. 
The album takes influences from numerous music genres such as black metal, ambient and avant-garde, as well as non-musical sources like the American drama television show Twin Peaks and primary member Phil Elverum's relationship to Khaela Maricich. 
Elverum was responsible for the album's production in its entirety.
Musically, The Glow Pt. 2 diverts from the band's previous studio release It Was Hot, We Stayed in the Water, and features experimental production, alongside musical techniques and lyrics that often reference nature and the Pacific Northwest.
For promotion, Elverum embarked on The Paper Opera Tour with Calvin Johnson and Khaela Maricich, before going on a solo tour of North America. 
In the years following its release, the album has been reissued multiple times, with the first in 2007 including a disc of bonus material. 
An immediate critical success, it has since appeared in multiple rankings of the best albums of the 2000s, and is considered by many music critics to be the Microphones' best work and an important release in the lo-fi genre.
